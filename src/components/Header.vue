              <p>Many research initiatives and projects who are at the crossroads of social innovation and web
                intelligence act so far in a dispersed manner and shall be given the opportunity to share
                knowledge and experiences in this workshop. Several social innovation issues demand novel
                solutions and new views for resolving environmental, human rights, social conflicts and many
                other issues..</p>

            <p>SIWEB Workshop is driven by social innovation projects like the EU projects under the umbrella
              of Collective Awareness Platforms which revalue entities and materials, use open platforms
              environments while challenging Web intelligence and cutting edge technologies
              (such as blockchains, crowdsourcing, gamification, etc). Such novel approaches can improve
              social innovation momentum with new forms for living, socializing, business uptaking, marketing,
              and several disruptive tasks. The Workshop targets work from academia, communities, or business
              sides with emphasis on how Web intelligent solutions can propose new and unconventional
              solutions for social good, innovation, and societal impact. </p>

            <p>SIWEB Workshop aims to bring together research initiatives, stakeholders, academia, business
              vendors, innovators, and projects who are at the edge of social innovation and Web intelligence.
              The presented papers should focus on those initiatives which strive for stimulating, setting up
              and sustaining innovation systems which support multiple actors such as citizens, communities,
              inventors, innovators, entrepreneurs, or public institutions in co-creating and strengthening
              societal and circular economy actions in-line with digital social innovation principles </p>
